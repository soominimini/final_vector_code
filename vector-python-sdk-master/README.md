# Anki/DDL Vector - Python SDK
by cyb3rdog

## With support for Production, EscapePod and OSKR robots!
Compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 - 20.04 and Python 3.6.1 - 3.9

This is the extended fork of the original Anki Vector Python SDK.

## Getting Started

For the steps undocumented here, you can still refer to [this original SDK documentation](https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/index.html).
*(TODO: docs are old and needs to be updated, contributors wanted)*

If you are new to the Vector's Python SDK, refer to this documentation anyways, as it still contains lots of valuable information.


### Python Installation

#### Windows:

If you dont have python installed yet, download and install it from the [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
Make sure to tick the “Add Python 3.X to PATH” checkbox on the Setup screen.

To avoid dificulties during the SDK install on your existing python installation, open the command line and run:

```
py -m pip install -U pip
py -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

#### Linux:

Open the Terminal and run following commands to install and update the Python, and packages required by SDK:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-tk python3-pil.imagetk build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev freeglut3
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
```

### SDK Installation

 - Note: Use either **```pip```** or **```pip3```** correspondingly to the Python version you are using.

In case you have previously installed the original ***Anki*** or ***Ikkez*** SDK, uninstall it/them with following command(s):

- ```pip uninstall anki_vector``` or ```pip3 uninstall anki_vector```
- ```pip uninstall ikkez_vector``` or ```pip3 uninstall ikkez_vector```

To install this new SDK, run:

- ```pip install cyb3r_vector_sdk``` or ```pip3 install cyb3r_vector_sdk```
and
- ```pip install "cyb3r_vector_sdk[3dviewer]"``` or ```pip3 install "cyb3r_vector_sdk[3dviewer]"```


To upgrade this SDK to its latest version, use:

- ```pip install cyb3r_vector_sdk --upgrade``` or ```pip3 install cyb3r_vector_sdk --upgrade```


If you want to know where the SDK files are installed, use following command:

- Windows:  ```py -c "import anki_vector as _; print(_.__path__)"```
- Linux:    ```python3 -c "import anki_vector as _; print(_.__path__)"```


### SDK Configuration

To configure the Python SDK for **Prod**, and/or **Prod+OSKR** robots, run:

- Windows:  **```py -m anki_vector.configure```**
- Linux:    **```python3 -m anki_vector.configure```**

To configure the Python SDK for **EscapePod**, and/or **EP+OSKR** robots, run:

- Windows:  **```py -m anki_vector.configure_pod```**
- Linux:    **```python3 -m anki_vector.configure_pod```**


### SDK Usage - EscapePod

You can either use the ```anki_vector.configure_pod``` in order to save your authentication into the sdk_config.ini file, and use all the [examples](https://github.com/cyb3rdog/vector-python-sdk/tree/master/examples) and your own programs and as you have them, OR you can use the Robot object setting (or sdk_config) with the ```escape_pod``` parameter to True, and passing just the robot's ip address:

```
    with anki_vector.Robot(ip="192.168.0.148", escape_pod=True) as robot:
        robot.behavior.say_text("Hello Escape Pod")
```


### Log Level

In order to change the log level to other then default value of `INFO`, set the `VECTOR_LOG_LEVEL` enviroment variable:

Allowed values are:
```
CRITICAL	= 50
FATAL 		= CRITICAL
ERROR 		= 40
WARNING 	= 30
WARN 		= WARNING
INFO 		= 20
DEBUG 		= 10
```

Example:

- Windows: ```SET VECTOR_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG```
- Lunux:   ```VECTOR_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"```
